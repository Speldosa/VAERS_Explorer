# VAERS_Explorer

This is a very rudimentary script, written in R, that is used to calculate ratios of type of symptoms from the different vaccine types against COVID-19 as reported in the [VAERS dataset](https://vaers.hhs.gov/). In order to run the script, you have to [download the raw data](You can download these at: https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/datasets.html?) yourself. Choose one of the Zip files containing three different csv files and place these in the folder "2021VAERSData".
